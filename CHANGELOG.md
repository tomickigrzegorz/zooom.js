## v1.4.0 (2026-05-27)

### Added

- **PanZoomPlugin** — new `zooom-panzoom.js` bundle: wheel / double-click / pinch / drag-to-pan zoom on top of the fit-to-viewport scale, with cursor-anchored zoom and viewport-clamped pan. Options: `maxScale` (3), `doubleClickScale` (2), `wheelStep` (0.15). Coordinates with SliderPlugin (swipe navigates at base scale, pans when zoomed) and adds iOS Safari touch hardening.
- **SliderPlugin options** — `hideButtons` (`true | number | 'mobile' | fn`), `gap` (px between slides), `loadingIndicator` (`true | 'auto' | fn`, toggles `.zooom-loading` while loading).

### Fixed

- **SliderPlugin** — lazy / `<picture>` images no longer open invisible, squished or blank: the peek resolves the correct `<source>` instantly and recomputes geometry on load. Outgoing slide clone no longer washed out by the overlay.
- **PanZoomPlugin** — click on the overlay now closes the zoom (instead of toggling); a click after pan + wheel-out to base scale now zooms again.

### Notes

- With PanZoomPlugin, single-click-to-close has a 300 ms latency (waits for a possible double-click); `Escape` stays instant. Install order: `.use(slider).use(panzoom)`.

## v1.2.1 (2024-06-20)

### Fixed

- Overlay misaligned and not full-width on pages with centered `<body>` (`max-width` + `margin: auto`)

---

## v1.2.0 (2026-05-19)

### Added

- **Accessibility** — built into core, always on:
  - Zoomable images receive `tabindex="0"` (when not already set) so keyboard users can reach them; `Enter` / `Space` opens the zoom
  - Overlay receives `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-label` derived from the image's `alt`
  - `aria-label` on the overlay is kept in sync as plugins navigate between images (via `ZooomContext.setCurrentImage`)
  - Cloned `<img>` gets `tabindex="-1"` and inherits `alt` from the original
  - Focus is moved to the cloned image on open and restored to the previously-focused element on close (deferred until after the close animation completes so the original image is visible again)
  - `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` are trapped inside the zoom layer (refocuses the clone) so keyboard users don't escape the modal
  - SliderPlugin counter element gets `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"`, so screen readers announce the full counter text (e.g. "3 / 11") on every navigation
- **Plugin system** — new `.use(plugin)` chainable API for extending Zooom with plugins
- **SliderPlugin** — separate `zooom-slider.js` bundle providing previous/next navigation buttons, keyboard arrow-key support and touch swipe
  - `effect: "slide"` — animated slide transition between images
  - `counter: true` — image counter (e.g. `3 / 10`) in the top-left corner
  - `preload: N` — warm the browser cache for N neighbour images on each side (uses `data-zooom-big`) so navigation feels instant
  - no `effect` option — instant image swap without animation
- New `ZooomContext` interface exposing `images`, `currentImage`, `currentClone`, `animTime`, `zIndex`, `overlayLayer`, lifecycle events (`open`, `close`, `keydown`) and methods (`zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `addStyle`, `setCurrentImage`, `setClone`, `notifyOpen`, `notifyClose`)
- Optional `ZooomPlugin.uninstall()` — cleanup hook for plugins (SliderPlugin implements it: removes nav buttons, counter and touch listeners)
- TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) shipped in `dist/types/` — TS consumers get full autocompletion and type-checking for `Zooom`, `SliderPlugin`, and the public types (`ConstructorObject`, `ZooomContext`, `ZooomPlugin`, `SliderOptions`, etc.)
- `package.json` `exports` field with conditional `import` / `require` / `types` resolution for both entry points: `import Zooom from 'zooom'` and `import SliderPlugin from 'zooom/slider'`

### Changed

- `package.json` entry points (`main`, `browser`, `module`) now point to `dist/` instead of `docs/`; fixed `module` field typo (`zooom.ems.min.js` → `zooom.es.min.js`); added `files` field to limit publish payload
- Public types moved from ambient `interface.d.ts` to an exporting module (`sources/js/types.ts`) — no more global namespace pollution for TS consumers
- Clone element switched from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed` — eliminates clipping by `body { overflow: hidden }` during zoom animation
- Removed IE (ES5) build targets from rollup config (`zooom.ie.min.js`, `zooom-slider.ie.min.js`)
- Core: shared `loadImage` helper between core and SliderPlugin, simplified resize/scroll wiring, internal clone tracking via `WeakSet` instead of ad-hoc properties on DOM nodes
- SliderPlugin: slide animation uses the Web Animations API (`Element.animate`) — cleaner cancellation when rapidly navigating; reads the active clone via `ZooomContext.currentClone` instead of querying the DOM

### Fixed

- Images with `loading="lazy"` staying permanently invisible after navigating with SliderPlugin and then closing
- Visual scaling artifact on first zoom-in click (caused by overflow clipping of absolute-positioned clone)
- Clone leak in DOM when rapidly clicking navigation buttons during an ongoing slide animation
- `onOpen` / `onClose` user callbacks and `figcaption` descriptions not firing during slide navigation

## v1.1.3 (2022-04-10)

### Fixed

- Release v1.1.2 contains files from v1.1.1 [#46](https://github.com/tomickigrzegorz/zooom.js/issues/46)

## v1.1.2 (2022-02-28)

### Fixed

- inline styles are removed when exiting zoom [#41](https://github.com/tomickigrzegorz/zooom.js/issues/41)

## v1.1.1 (2022-02-02)

### Added

- generating a separate file for IE browser, rollup.config - typescript target [es6, es5]

### Changed

- simplification of the 'overlay' styling

```js
overlay: {
  color: '#fff',
  opacity: 80,
},
```

on

```js
// overlay layer color and opacity, rgba, hsla, ...
overlay: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)",
```

### Build

- adding method and props in 'terser' mangle, adding an undeline `_zooomInit = () => {...}`

```js
terserOptions: {
  mangle: {
    properties: {
      regex: /^_/,
    },
  },
},
```

> This solution allowed to reduce the library by as much as 23%

## v1.1.0 (2022-01-04)

### Added

- a new parameter `data-zooom-big` has been added. With its help, we can open a larger version of the photo - [example-large-photo](https://tomickigrzegorz.github.io/zooom.js/#large-photo)  
  This solution is needed to optimize the website. We only display a thumbnail, only by clicking it downloads the photo from the `data-zooom-big` parameter and zooms in.

```html
<img
  class="img-zoom"
  loading="lazy"
  width="576"
  height="384"
  data-zooom-big="large-image.jpg"
  src="image-thumbnail.jpg"
/>
```
